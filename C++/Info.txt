ParticleClass.hpp:
+ A class for easily creating a particle system
+ Rendered using OpenGL
+ Currently requires the correct vertex layout and vertex array to be set up before hand.
+ Currently requires a fragment and vertex shader to be prepared before hand.
+ Able to customize certain physics properties and apperance.
+ Dependencies: GLFW, GLAD, GLAD is dependent on KHR

Implementation.cpp:
+ Made for windows 32 bit
+ Window created using GLFW
+ OpenGL initialized using GLAD
+ An implementation for the particle system.
+ Custom shader with uniforms.
+ Dependencies: ParticleClass.hpp, GLFW, GLAD, GLAD is dependent on KHR

ParticleSystem.exe:
+ Made for WIN32
+ Compiled version of Implementation.cpp and demonstrates the particle system.
+ DEPENDENT ON THE VISUAL STUDIO DISTRIBUTABLE (VCRUNTIME140.dll; Static compiling does not fix the issue, sort of unfixable.)
